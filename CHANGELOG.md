# Changelog

All significant changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.0] – 2025-12-09

### Added

-   **Global database helpers** integrating the `codemonster-ru/database` package:
    -   `db()` — returns the active database connection
    -   `schema()` — returns schema builder for the selected connection
    -   `transaction()` — executes callbacks inside a DB transaction
-   Full PHPUnit test coverage for:
    -   `db()` helper
    -   `schema()` helper
    -   With isolated `DatabaseManager` and fake container bindings
-   Support for SQLite, MySQL and future drivers automatically via `ConnectionInterface::schema()`.

### Changed

-   `SupportFakeContainer` updated for correct behavior with database helpers:
    -   `singleton()` is now **eager**, ensuring immediate instance creation
    -   Improved compatibility with Annabel-style lazy container contracts
    -   Fully stable integration with request/view/db helpers
-   Strengthened test isolation:
    -   `reset()` now clears both bindings and instances
    -   All tests run without requiring the Annabel framework

### Fixed

-   `schema()` test failing due to instantiation of an abstract Grammar class  
    → Now resolved automatically by the database package selecting proper driver grammar.
-   DB helper now correctly bootstraps connection configuration even without other framework components.

## [1.2.0] – 2025-11-24

### Added

-   Added unit tests for the global `db()` helper, including verification of passing a connection name and returning a `Connection` instance.
-   Added the `FakeConnection` and `FakeDatabaseManager` classes to tests to isolate behavior and enable stable testing without a real database.
-   Added the `reset()` method to `SupportFakeContainer` to clean up the container between tests.
-   Improved testing infrastructure: tests are now fully isolated and independent of the Annabel framework.

## [1.1.0] – 2025-11-16

### Added

-   New `abort()` helper for throwing HTTP-like exceptions with a status code.
-   Introduced `HttpStatusExceptionInterface` extending `Throwable` for consistent type support.
-   Added test coverage for `abort()` including status code and message handling.

### Updated

-   Documentation: added `abort()` to the list of provided helpers.

## [1.0.0] – 2025-10-28

### Added

-   Global helper functions for the entire **Codemonster PHP ecosystem**:
    -   `config()` — access or modify configuration values
    -   `env()` — read environment variables
    -   `dump()`, `dd()` — elegant variable dumping
    -   `request()` — get current HTTP request or input
    -   `response()`, `json()` — send structured responses
    -   `router()` / `route()` — define and access routes
    -   `session()` — read or write session data
    -   `view()` / `render()` — render templates and return responses
-   Seamless integration with the **Annabel** framework via `app()` container
-   Standalone compatibility when Annabel is not installed
-   Full PHPUnit test coverage for all helpers (18 tests / 25 assertions)
-   Support for **PHP 8.2 – 8.4** and PHPUnit **9–12**
